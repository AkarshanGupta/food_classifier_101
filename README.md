## Introduction

This project is designed to create a web-based tool for predicting food categories from uploaded images. The tool leverages a pre-trained VGG model to classify images into one of 101 food categories. Users can upload an image of food, and the system will analyze the image to predict the specific food category it belongs to. This tool aims to facilitate easy and accurate food identification, which can be useful for various applications, such as dietary analysis, food recognition in mobile apps, and automated food categorization systems.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are to:
1. Develop an intuitive web interface where users can upload images of food.
2. Utilize a pre-trained VGG model to accurately predict the food category of the uploaded image.
3. Provide immediate feedback to users with the predicted food category.

## Technology

### Gradio

Gradio is a Python library that allows for the easy creation of web-based interfaces for machine learning models. It will be used to develop the user interface for the food category prediction tool, enabling users to interact with the model by uploading images and receiving predictions.

### Python

Python is the programming language used to implement the logic of the project. It supports a wide range of libraries and tools for machine learning, data manipulation, and web development. In this project, Python will be used to integrate the VGG model, handle image processing, and manage user interactions through Gradio.

### PyTorch

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework used for building and training neural networks. It will be utilized to work with the pre-trained VGG model, perform inference on the uploaded images, and handle the computations required for food category classification.

# Few Things 
1. This project includes two notebooks:
   - The first notebook had issues such as low accuracy, overfitting, and underfitting.
   - I worked on resolving these issues, and the **Final_Notebook** effectively addresses:
     - The accuracy problem.
     - Overfitting and underfitting issues.

2. You can approach this project in two ways:
